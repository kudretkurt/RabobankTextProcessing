# RabobankTextProcessing

This project is for the assessment at Rabobank. It contains two interfaces and two classes at predefined location and namespace `Test`.

## The code

- API project written in .Net 7 and used Swagger.
- The library is written in .Net 7.
- The Unit tests are written in .Net 7, as it's an LTS version.

## Building the projects

Building is as easy as opening the solution in Visual Studio and building it, assuming that:
- .Net 7 is installed.
- You have access to Nuget to retrieve packages.

To run the project, make sure to have API startup projects. 

## Testing

- Unit tests are written in xUnit, since this is the most popular framework at the moment. Also I used FluentAssertions.
- You can use swagger interface or Postman for end-user testing.
